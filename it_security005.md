### defense in Depth

The concept of having multiple .overlaping systems of defense to protect IT systems

#### Disabling unecessary componets 

Attack ventors:

    a method/mechanism in which an attacker or malware gains access to a system or network

    email attachments, user inputs, net protocols/services/interfaces

attack surfaces:

    sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system

disable unscessary components to resduce attack surfaces.

Reduce software deployments (have a unified solutions)

Deploy many security walls


#### Host-based firewalls

Protect individual hosts from being compromised when they're used in untrusted ,  potentially malicious environments

also protect inside trusted network compromise

only allows traffic to specific roles and tasks

Bastion Host/Networks:

    Deployed on the internet to reduce system compromise

    have limted network connectivity

VPNs can also be used to protect againest remote attackers in a network

AD in windows can be used to monitor and log for firewalls compromise by system admins
