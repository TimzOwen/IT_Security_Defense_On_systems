## Security at Work Place

#### Security Goals

Understand compy policy when it comes to security

for Credict cards:

    PCI DSS(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) rules must be followed

objectives of PCI DSS:
    
    1. Build and maintain a secure netwrok systems
        Install and Maintain firewall configuration
        Not to use vendor default systems and password on security parameter

    2. Protect cardholder data
        protect stored cardholder data
        Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open public networks

    3. Maintain a vulnarability management Program
        protect all systems againest malware and regulary u[date antivirus
        Maintain secure systems and application

    4. Implement Strong Access Control measures
        restrict access to cardholder data by other businesses
        identify and authenticate access to system components
        restrict physical access

    5. Regularly monitor and test networks
        Track and monitor all security access
        testing defences

    6. Maintain an information Security Policy
        to maintain policy that addresses information security fro all personel


#### Measuring and assesing risk 

its all about:

    Determining risks/exposure

    understanding likelihood of attacks

    Designing defenses around these risks to minimize impact of attacks

threat modeling:

    understand risk

understand vulnarabilities aroud your system and network

vulnarability scanner:

    computer program desinged to assess computers,computer systems,networks or appplication for weakness

Tools:

    Nessus

    OpenVas

    Qualys

scaners vulnurability , backdoor and  misconfigured services among others

penetration testing:

    Practice of trying to break into a systsem or network to verify systems is in place

#### Privacy policy:

Protect data againest misuse by employees or company or intruders into the system

privacy policy:

    oversee the access and use of sensitive data

Audit data access -> ensure sensitive data is accessed by authorized people only\

#### User Habits

No password reuse and have regular password change 

OTP authentication and mail phishing should stop

#### Third-Party security 

Manage security assesments for security policy 

test hardware systems for vulnarabilities

use questionnaire for reports 

on premise installation, manage the installation to make sure it doesn't compromise your system
