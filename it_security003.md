### Authentication

#### Identification

    The idea of describing an entity uniquely

authn- Authentication
authz-authorization

#### Password policy system:

    Character complexity

    presence of dictionary words

    Length Requirement

#### Multifactor Authentication:


#### Multifactor Authentication

single factor:

    Username

    Password

Multifactor:

    A system where users are authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information or objects

    * Something you know == PIN/PASSWORD

    * Something you have == ATM/BANK CARD

    * Something you are == BIOMETRIC ID

Physical Tokens:

    They are usually short token and One-time Password

    USB with secret token

    Standalone device with generators

    simple key with traditional lock

Example of OTP are TOTP Time-based token password.

Network Time Protocol aids in time authentication when TOTP is used

#### Biometric authentication

    The process of using unique physiological characteristics of an individual to do authentication

Universal Second Factor:

    U2f->evolution of physical token generated by Gooogle,Yubico and XNP semiconductors

#### Certificate

This are public keys signed by CA-Certificate Authority

Part involves client authenticating the server

Dates:

    Not valid before

    Not valid after

Certificate Revocation List (CRL):

    A singed list published by the CA which defines certificates that have been explicitly revoked


#### LDAP

Light Weight Directory Protocol:

    an open industry-standard protocol for accessing and maintaining directory services

Uses Data Information Tree (DIT) to retrieve data

### RADIUS:

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service:

    A protocol that provides AAA services for users on network

carries std authentication protocol like EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

### Kerberos

A network Authentication protocol that uses "tickets" to allow entities to prove their Identity over potentially insecure channels to provide mutual authentication

also uses symmetric encryption to protect from eves dropping and playback

#### How kerberos operate:

    Enter password and username on your machine

    The password is generated as a symmetric password

    client sends plain text to Kerberos

    checks for account

    TGS-Ticket Granting Services is used to send Message

### TACACS+:

Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus

used for :

    Device administration

    Accounting

    Authorization
    
    Authentication

### SSO

#### Single Sing-On

    An authentication concept that allows users to authenticate once and be granted to a lot of services and application

Uses central authentication like LDAP

Example of SSO:

    OpenID->Third party authentication services

    Access site without creating new account

### Authorization and Access Control

#### Access Control

OAuth--> One mostly used open standard for authorization

    --> Allows users to access third-party websites and application without sharing user's credentials

OAuth->Authorization system

OpenID->Authentication system

#### Access Control List:

    A way of definfing permission/authorization for objects

#### Accounting

Keeping record of what resources and services your users accessed,or what they did when they were us\ing your system

Auditing->Reviewing Accounting

TACACS+-->Device access AAA system that manages who has access to your network device and what they do on them

RADIUS will track:

    Session duration

    client location

    bandwidth

    other resources used during the session

CISCO AAAs system:

    Command execution

    connection to and from network devices

    system details
    
    connections
