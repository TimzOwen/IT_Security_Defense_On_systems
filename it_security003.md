authn- Authentication
authz-authorization

#### Password policy system:

    Character complexity

    presence of dictionary words

    Length Requirement

#### Multifactor Authentication:


#### Multifactor Authentication

single factor:

    Username

    Password

Multifactor:

    A system where users are authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information or objects

    * Something you know == PIN/PASSWORD

    * Something you have == ATM/BANK CARD

    * Something you are == BIOMETRIC ID

Physical Tokens:

    They are usually short token and One-time Password

    USB with secret token

    Standalone device with generators

    simple key with traditional lock

Example of OTP are TOTP Time-based token password.

Network Time Protocol aids in time authentication when TOTP is used

#### Biometric authentication

    The process of using unique physiological characteristics of an individual to do authentication

Universal Second Factor:

    U2f->evolution of physical token generated by Gooogle,Yubico and XNP semiconductors
