#### Symmetric cryptography


Symmetric-key algorithm

    use same key to encrypt and decrypt messages

    substitution cipher-->encryption mechanism that replaces your plaintext with ciphertext

    caesar Cipher--> decryption substitution alphabet key

    TOT13-->alphabet rotated 13 places

        a) stream cipher-->Takes stream of input and encrypts one digit at a time outputting one char at a time each

        b) block cipher--> takes data in, places it into block of fixed size and encodes the entire block as one

    initialization vector--> a bit random data incorporated into encryption key and the key used to encrypt data

#### Symmetric encryption Algorithm

DES-Data Encryption Standards:-by IBM

    -Designed in 1970

    -uses 64 bit key sizes

    -8 bit used for parity checking

    -adaopted as official FIPS

FIPS-Federal Standard Information Processing

    - encrypting government data

brute-force attack-guessing codes to crack a password/ algorithm

NIST -National Institute os Standards and Technology

    Adopted AES a replacement of DES

    Advanced Encryption standards

Factors to consider when choosing algorithms

    speed

    ease of implementation

    RC4(Rivest Cipher 4)-->gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity of use\
